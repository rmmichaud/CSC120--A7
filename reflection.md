Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the constructors in Library, Cafe, and House in the event that only an address and/or name was supplied, the classes would still be able to run and a new Library/House would be able to be initialized.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the overloading/overriding worked pretty smoothly. The idea of overloading makes sense to me and therefore I was successful in implementing the idea. I would recommend that students taking the course in the future have a clear idea on the difference between overloading and overriding before they start the assignment, as that was very helpful for me.
